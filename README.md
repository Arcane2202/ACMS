---ACMS (Admission Coaching Management System)---

This project waS made with the goal of creating a platform for students,teachers,managements and admin (of a coaching center)
so that they can use it to maintain all their current, previous and possibly fututre records.

This project has four major pannels - admin, manager, teacher, student all of which is made for its corresponding users
keeping their most basic and important tasks in mind.

An admin can use this to view, update, add data of branches, manager of those branches, courses, subjects, overall exam
and result publishing and batches of all the branches of the coaching center.

Managers can use this to approve new teachers and students to their assigned branches or delete and manage the ones who
are already approved.

Teachers may use this to manage results of all the students of a branch of their assigned branch and also remain informed
about the most updated routine assigned to them.

Students may use this to keep a track of their assigned subjects, upcoming results or classes of the whole week, their own 
performances on all the previous exams.

Almost all the data was shown in the project using inner join or other forms of joins between two or more tables and all
of them were updated when any data was changed by the users. For more convenience search feature was added in each of the 
pannels.
